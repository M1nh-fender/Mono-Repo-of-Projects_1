npm cannot have capital letters in the directory...

'The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that npm enforces certain naming restrictions for package names, including disallowing capital letters. Since your project directory name contains capital letters, `create-next-app` is not able to proceed.'

npm issue made me go to a different directory so results are not shown on the docker container but I have learned dev container so it is ok
